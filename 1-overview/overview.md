# 1. Overview

Domain-driven design is a software design that focuses on understanding underlying business. It is useful for long-term projects because it leads to high-quality software that serves users. It helps when dealing with difficult problems, keeps track of core problems and prevents us from getting lost in the code.

Domain is an area that project covers, it has its own terminology, requirements, problems to solve. Domain has its natural boundaries too, it does not cover everything.
